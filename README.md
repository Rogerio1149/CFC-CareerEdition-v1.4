After getting permission from /u/jonesguy14 to post this, I am now releasing my expansion of College Football Coach for android. It's still in development, but should be fully functional now.
Please share comments, suggestions, bugs, etc.

College Football Coach: Career Edition is a re-imagining and expansion of the popular Football Coach game. This game adds thousands of new lines of code and puts you in the role of a head coach of a college football dynasty in a totally dynamic and fully customizable game universe!

Use your recruiting, game planning, and roster management skills to take your college to the top! But don't get fired!

**FAQ**

* * * ABOUT SAVING GAMES * * *
This game is currently designed to be played a full season at a time. Save files will always start at the beginning of the season in which the save was made. At the START of each season, a pop up will ask you to save the game. You can also save games just prior to recruiting!

**PLAY BY PLAY**
To view game play log, click SCHEDULE, then choose the game you want to view by pressing the Score Box. Then when the pop up appears, click on the blue menu bar at the top.

**HELP**
Feel free to ask questions via reddit community at /r/footballcoach

As this game is completely free and open source, any help would be appreciated. This game was developed by one guy and is being continued on by myself in my spare time. If you do come across any bugs or issues, please post to reddit, github or contact me. Constructive criticism and feedback are appreciated!
